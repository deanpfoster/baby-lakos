I haven't been able to find John Lakos' email.  Should anyone know it,
let me know and I'll send along the following email.  I tried his
current employer also (Bear-Sterns) but the postmaster never replied.
:-(

Subject: taking your name in vain


Hello John;

	I've been creating a smallish (65kloc) C++ project for the
past few years.  (It uses statistics to learn how to play go.  So far
it is really stupid.)  In the process I've developed some make files
that implement many of the ideas from your Large Scale's book.  Since
I'm planning on taking the go program itself Open Source, I was
thinking of first releasing the Makefiles as Open Source.  So the
question was what should I call it?  

	I don't want to use your name without your blessing.  I was
thinking of something like baby_lakos, or gnu_lakos.  (I don't think
the make files will work with much outside of gnu-make and gnu-gcc.)
Somehow levelized_regression_testing_include_guarding_makefiles just
doesn't roll off the tongue.  If you want to see the code, I've put
it:

              http://diskworld.wharton.upenn.edu/lakos.tar.gz

thanks,

dean

p.s. In case it isn't obvious, thanks for writing a wonderful book!
